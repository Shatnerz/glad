This is a remake of the game engine for Gladiator, a 1995 Gauntlet-like game
create by Forgetten Sages.

This was ported over from a private mercurial BitBucket repository to my
public GitHub repository.

All of the art was found on the `SourceForge discussion`_ provided with
the blessing of the original developers.
